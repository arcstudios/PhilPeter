CSS Framework: Bootstrap
jQuery
Sequence.js for slides
Bootstrap JS
Font awesome

Refer to the 'bower.json' file for more info

Naming Conventions

Paths

Images are contained in the 'assets' folder except the images required by the slides section. These are to be found in 'images' inside the root folder

All scripts, external and custom are contained in the 'js' folder

1) wordpress

2) meanstack
The static files can be used inside a meanstack app and generated using node
